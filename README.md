My oh so knowledgable take on Pokemon. (I know a lot about Pokemon)

Also a means to learn Go.

Top 3 Pokemon  
Giardiniera  
Kathmandu  
Nosferatu

So this is a Pokemon knockoff and because I know so much Pokemon it will have mechanics that work exactly like the Pokemon do.  
The user enters the name of a, a uh, *thing*, like they name of the creature, creature stats are generated from the name. The same name will generate the same stats if input more than once, it is consistent.  
There will be some combat system of rival *yet to be named things* to compete

Basic stats  
HP: your usual  hit points  
Attack: how effective a hit is  
Defense: mitigating a hit  
Speed: determines order of move in battle  

TBD: some kind of type modifier. If you want to get ridiculous you can use some AI to categorize the input and bin it into a type. Different advantages/disadvantages per type and type versus type.
